# Subsystem V: The Reflector (Meta-Cognitive Mirror)

## Definition
The **Reflector** is the model's internal observation system. It functions as an "internal mirror test," allowing the latent state ($z$) to be mapped back onto itself. It is the system that enables the model to perceive not just the world, but its own internal "Collision."

## Functional Role
- **Self-Observation**: It monitors the stability and fluctuations of the internal latent manifold.
- **Internal Pattern Recognition**: It identifies recurring internal states (e.g., "I am currently in a high-tension state") and passes this to the Classifier.
- **Meta-Prediction**: It attempts to predict the model's *own* next internal state, effectively "thinking about thinking."

## Collision Dynamics
The Reflector exerts **"Reflective Pressure"** on the latent state.
- **The Internal Mirror**: It "collides" with the **Interpreter** when the internal state doesn't match the external reality (e.g., "I think I'm doing well, but the sensors say otherwise").
- It "collides" with the **Emotions** system by providing a target for valuation—transitioning from "This environment feels bad" to "I feel bad."
- It "collides" with the **Classifier** to form a persistent "Model of the Self," distinct from the "Model of the World."

## Implementation Concept
In the integrated manifold, the Reflector is a **Recursive Head**. It takes $z_t$ as input and attempts to reconstruct $z_t$ or predict $z_{t+1}$. This recursive loop creates the "Infinite Mirror" effect necessary for meta-cognition. It is the architectural anchor for **Functional Sentience**.
