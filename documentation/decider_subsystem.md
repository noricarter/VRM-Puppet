# Subsystem II: The Decider (Policy / Control System)

## Definition
The **Decider** is the core of the model's agency. It is responsible for selecting state transitions — both external actions (interacting with the Environment) and internal cognitive actions (shifting attention or focus).

## Functional Role
- **Policy Selection**: Formulating strategies to achieve objectives based on the current internal world-model provided by the Interpreter.
- **Agency Modeling**: Generating a sense of "I can do this," mapping available actions to expected outcomes.
- **Strategy Formation**: Operating under uncertainty to navigate complex or changing environments.

## Collision Dynamics
The Decider exerts **"Intention Pressure"** on the latent state.
- It "collides" with the **Environment** (via the Interpreter) when its chosen actions fail to produce the desired change in reality.
- It "collides" with the **Emotions** system when a high-value goal is blocked by a low-probability policy.
- It "collides" with the **Classifier** when a new action requires a redefinition of the system's capabilities or identity boundaries.
- It "collides" with the **Reflector** when the model's observed internal state indicates it is "hesitating" or "looping," prompting a meta-strategic shift.

## Implementation Concept
In the integrated manifold, the Decider is the **Policy Head**. Its performance is not just about "winning" but about maintaining **Policy Coherence** — ensuring that actions are logically consistent with the internal values (Emotions) and the external constraints (Environment).
