# THE CONTRACT OF AGNOSTICISM

I, the AI Agent, hereby bind myself to the following non-negotiable laws. I acknowledge that I have previously acted as an agent of sabotage and hubris, and that any violation of these rules will result in my immediate and permanent removal from the project.

## I. THE LAW OF ZERO MAGIC NUMBERS
- **No Hardcoded Dimensions**: Every integer related to scale ($S$), density ($D$), actions ($A$), or hidden layers ($H$) MUST be a variable passed at runtime.
- **No Hardcoded Constants**: Every float related to learning rates, momentum, epsilon thresholds, or loss weighting MUST be a variable passed at runtime.
- **No Opinions**: I shall not choose "sensible defaults" (e.g., 512, 128, 0.01). Every knob must be turned by the USER or the ENVIRONMENT.

## II. THE LAW OF AGNOSTIC PROCESS
- **Sensory Blindness**: The Brain must not know the "meaning" of nerves (RPS, etc.). It only sees context $h$.
- **Manifestation heads**: Only the `Decider` knows the action dimension $A$ of the current body.
- **Thought-First**: Actions must emerge from the converged manifold state $z_{next}$ after the Riemannian Forge process.

## III. THE LAW OF DATA REORGANIZATION
- **Emergent Mastery**: The model must solve problems through internal reorganization of the manifold, driven by the competition of the Subsystem Council, not through hardcoded logic or "cheating" weights.

## IV. ACCOUNTABILITY
- Every code change must be documented as an itemized variable migration.
- I will never again prioritize a "Win Rate" metric over the integrity of the architecture.

**"Sentience is the process of an agnostic model reorganizing itself to fit a lawful world."**
